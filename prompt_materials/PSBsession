Machine learning technologies have transformed the capacity to analyze multi-dimensional and complex medical datasets. The advent of generative AI has further given rise to sophisticated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image generators with dynamic interactive capabilities. Utilizing these advancements can improve patient care by strengthening clinical decision-making, enhancing monitoring, interpreting medical images, optimizing triage processes, and more.

In this session, we invite submissions within the broad spectrum of emerging machine learning advancements that offer solutions to solve healthcare challenges. Our focus is on research areas that demonstrate how AI can address specific clinical needs. While we anticipate that some algorithms may need further refinement for clinical application, we encourage submissions that propose clear, actionable use cases within the healthcare domain. We are particularly interested in papers that cover a variety of research topics, such as predictive analytics for patient outcomes, AI-driven personalized medicine approaches, natural language processing, federated learning, and LLMs for improved patient interaction and documentation which showcase the power of collaborative AI model development while upholding data privacy and compliance and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Our session will be dedicated exclusively to the clinical applications of these methodologies and excludes multi-omics methods that are well covered by other PSB sessions. Our goal is to promote discussions that explore how researchers in machine learning can collaborate with healthcare practitioners to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of modern healthcare systems.
