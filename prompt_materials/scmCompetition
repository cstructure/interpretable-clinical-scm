The purpose of this activity is to create a relationship between factors+interventions+outcomes.
These 3 variables can be represented by a node. To add a variable, click on “Add node” and enter
relevant information to describe it in the Narrative section.
Factors: can be any variable that may impact interventions and outcomes. The most important
factors for real world analyses are variables that cause the intervention AND cause the outcome
(aka common causes), such as disease severity because they introduce bias when analyzing the
relationship between intervention and outcome.
Factors can be unadjusted or adjusted.
In unadjusted factors, no attempt has been made to control for confounding variables. In other
words, the relationships between variables are examined without considering other factors that might
influence these relationships. This can lead to biased estimates of causal effects if there are
unobserved confounders, which is usually reflected by an orange arrow between nodes.
In adjusted factors, these variables have been controlled for in the model. Adjustments are typically
made to account for potential confounding factors that could distort the true causal relationship
between variables of interest. This is depicted by a gray arrow between the nodes. It is the
participants goal to evaluate each variable and determine whether or not to adjust. Diagrams with
most adjusted variables (least unadjusted) are typically more reflective of accurate structural causal
models.

While inside the canvas there are a few keyboard shortcuts to be aware of that can convert nodes to
different types of variables. Simply, click on the node and press one of the following letters on your
keyboard.
U = unadjusted
A = adjusted
I = action
O outcome
